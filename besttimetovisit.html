		<h3>October to March (Winter Months) is universally considered the best time to explore the Golden Triangle.</h3>
			The weather during these months is cool and pleasant, making it ideal for sightseeing and outdoor activities. Delhi,
		 		known for its extreme temperatures, becomes especially enjoyable with mild sunny days and cooler nights. 
					Agra, with its marble structures, including the Taj Mahal, 
						becomes more visually stunning under the gentle winter sun.

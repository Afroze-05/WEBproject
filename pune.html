<h2 align="left">The Shaniwar Wada was normally the seven-story capital building of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire.
 It was supposed to be made entirely of stone. However, after the completion of the base floor or the first story,
 the people of Satara (the national capital) complained to the Chhatrapati Shahu I (Emperor) saying that a stone monument
 can be sanctioned and built only by the emperor himself and not the Peshwas. Following this, 
an official letter was written to the Peshwas stating that the remaining building had to be made of brick and not stone.</h2>

<h4>The Eiffel Tower (/ˈaɪfəl/ EYE-fəl; French: Tour Eiffel 
 is a wrought-iron lattice tower on the Champ de Mars in Paris, France.
 It is named after the engineer Gustave Eiffel, whose company designed 
and built the tower from 1887 to 1889.Locally nicknamed "La dame de fer" 
(French for "Iron Lady"), it was constructed as the centerpiece of the 1889 World's Fair,
 and to crown the centennial anniversary of the French Revolution. Although initially criticised by some of 
France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, it has since become a global cultural icon of France 
and one of the most recognisable structures in the world.[5] The tower received 5,889,000 visitors in 2022.
 The Eiffel Tower is the most visited monument with an entrance fee in the world:[7] 6.91 million people ascended it in 2015.
 It was designated a monument historique in 1964, and was named part of a UNESCO World Heritage Site
 ("Paris, Banks of the Seine") in 1991.

<h1>LONDON BRIDGE</h1>
<h4>London Bridge refers to several historic crossings that have spanned the River
 Thames between the City of London and Southwark, in central London since Roman times. 
The current crossing, which opened to traffic in 1973, is a box girder bridge built from concrete and steel. 
It replaced a 19th-century stone-arched bridge, which in turn superseded a 600-year-old stone-built medieval
 structure. In addition to the roadway, for much of its history, the broad medieval bridge supported an
 extensive built up area of homes and businesses part of the City's Bridge Ward and its southern end in
 Southwark was guarded by a large stone City gateway. The medieval bridge was preceded by a succession of 
timber bridges, the first of which was built by the Roman founders of London (Londinium) around 50 AD.</h4>
